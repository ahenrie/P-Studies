# Machine Learning: Supervised vs. Unsupervised Learning

Machine learning is a subfield of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on developing algorithms and models that enable computers to learn and make predictions or decisions based on data. There are various approaches to machine learning, but two fundamental paradigms are supervised learning and unsupervised learning. In this markdown document, we will explore the key differences between these two approaches.

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. In other words, each data point in the training dataset is associated with a corresponding target or label, which represents the correct output or class. The goal of supervised learning is to learn a mapping from input features to the correct output labels.

Key characteristics of supervised learning:

- **Labeled Data:** The training dataset includes input features and corresponding output labels.
- **Prediction:** The algorithm is trained to predict the output labels for new, unseen data.
- **Examples:** Classification (assigning data points to predefined classes) and regression (predicting numeric values) are common tasks in supervised learning.
- **Evaluation:** Model performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and mean squared error.

### Examples of Supervised Learning Algorithms:

- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Support Vector Machines
- Neural Networks
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Random Forest

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is given a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. Instead of labeled data, unsupervised learning algorithms aim to discover patterns, structures, or relationships within the data itself.

Key characteristics of unsupervised learning:

- **Unlabeled Data:** The training dataset consists of input features without corresponding output labels.
- **Clustering:** Grouping similar data points into clusters is a common task in unsupervised learning.
- **Dimensionality Reduction:** Reducing the number of features while preserving relevant information is another common use case.
- **Anomaly Detection:** Identifying unusual patterns or outliers in the data.

### Examples of Unsupervised Learning Algorithms:

- K-Means Clustering
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
- t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE)
- Autoencoders
